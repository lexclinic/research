# LexClinic Research

This repository hosts **LexClinic research memos**, focusing on various aspects of our work. These memos are organized into topic-specific directories, each containing related research.

## 🌐 Accessing the Memos

The memos are rendered and accessible via GitHub Pages:

👉 [https://lexclinic.github.io/research/](https://lexclinic.github.io/research/)

## 📂 Directory Structure (As of September 14, 2025)

- `index.html`: The landing page that lists and renders all memos.
- `signatures/`: Contains research memos related to digital signatures.
- `LICENSE`: Specifies the licensing terms for the content.

## 📝 Adding a New Memo

To contribute a new memo:

1. **Create a Directory**: If your memo pertains to a new topic, create a new directory under the root of the repository. For example, for memos related to "smart contracts," create a `smart_contracts/` directory.
2. **Add a Markdown File**: Within the appropriate directory, add a `.md` file for your memo.
   - Use descriptive filenames that summarize the topic.
   - Example filenames:
     - `inverted-precedent.md`
     - `joyfork-vs-ragequit.md`
     - `erc-7827-integration.md`
3. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes and push them to the `main` branch.
4. **Automatic Rendering**: The new memo will automatically appear on the [GitHub Pages site](https://lexclinic.github.io/research/).

## ⚙️ Development Details

- **GitHub Pages Configuration**: The site is configured to serve from the root of the repository.
- **Memo Rendering**: The `index.html` uses JavaScript to fetch and render `.md` files from both the root directory and any subdirectories.

## 🤖 Generating AI Session

This section documents how portions of this README and supporting files (like `index.html`) were produced with AI assistance. ✨

1. **🚀 Initiate AI Session**: A ChatGPT session was started to generate and refine content.
2. **💡 Provide Context**: The repository structure, goals, and desired HTML behavior were described to the AI.
3. **🔍 Review Output**: The generated text and code were reviewed for accuracy, clarity, and alignment with project goals.
4. **🛠 Implement Changes**: Approved suggestions were incorporated into the README, `index.html`, and other files.
5. **✅ Test Functionality**: The HTML and instructions were verified to ensure they correctly render memos and convey guidance.
